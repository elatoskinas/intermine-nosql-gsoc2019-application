# Intermine NoSQL GSoC 2019 Project Proposal
The repo provides a proposal for GSoC 2019 Intermine's [NoSQL Project](http://intermine.org/internships/project-ideas/2019/#implementing-a-graph-or-tuple-based-backing-database-for-intermine), utilizing MongoDB as the new datastore.

It should be noted that the ideas presented in the doc are relatively loose and unrefined. However, they can be used freely for future endeavours.
